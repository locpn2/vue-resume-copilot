# Progress: Resume Copilot

## 1. What Works

  - `projectbrief.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `activeContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`

## 2. What's Left to Build

- Develop the `HomePage` component with personal information, experience, and skills.
- Develop the `ContactPage` component with contact information.
- Develop the `ChatPage` component with AI integration.
- Implement logging and unit testing.
- Integrate CLI scripts.

## 3. Current Status

- Project setup and documentation are complete.
- Core `memory-bank` files have been initialized.
- Development of the `HomePage` component is the next step.

## 4. Known Issues

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- The decision to use Vue.js for frontend development was based on its popularity, ease of use, and extensive ecosystem.
- The decision to use CSS Modules for component-specific styling was based on its ability to prevent CSS conflicts and improve code maintainability.
- The decision to use Jest and Vue Test Utils for unit testing was based on their compatibility with Vue.js and their ease of use.
