# Progress: Resume Copilot

## 1. What Works

- Project setup and initialization.
- `.clinerules` configuration.
- `memory-bank` initialization with core files:
  - `projectbrief.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `activeContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`
- Implementation of Glassmorphism UI for main components (`App.vue`, `HomeView.vue`, `AboutView.vue`, `ChatPage.vue`).
- Setup of routing system with routes for Home, About, and Chat pages.
- Integration of `ChatSuggestion.vue` component with suggestion data.
- Implementation of logging module in main components.
- Setup of unit testing with Jest and Vue Test Utils for components (`ChatSuggestion.vue`, `NavBar.vue`).

## 2. What's Left to Build

- Develop the `HomePage` component with detailed personal information, experience, and skills.
- Enhance the `ContactPage` component with comprehensive contact information.
- Develop the `ChatPage` component with AI integration for resume advice.
- Integrate CLI scripts for automation.

## 3. Current Status

- Project setup and documentation are complete.
- Core `memory-bank` files have been initialized and updated.
- UI design with Glassmorphism, routing, logging, and unit testing are implemented.
- Development of detailed content for main pages and AI integration are the next steps.

## 4. Known Issues

- None

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- The decision to use Vue.js for frontend development was based on its popularity, ease of use, and extensive ecosystem.
- The decision to use CSS Modules for component-specific styling was based on its ability to prevent CSS conflicts and improve code maintainability.
- The decision to use Jest and Vue Test Utils for unit testing was based on their compatibility with Vue.js and their ease of use.
- The adoption of Glassmorphism UI design was chosen for a modern and visually appealing interface.
